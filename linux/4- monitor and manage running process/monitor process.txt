program is series of instruction tell pc what to do : note when u start it instructions copied to memory and allocate vairable space need to manage execution
process have id for itself and id for his parent 
as tree each process have(parent process id, processItself id) 
inital process id = 1  and his parent pid = 0  called systemd


states of running process that consumes from cpu mempry or hard disk:
1-running(R)    : u start app
2-stopped(T)    : u closed app
3-Zombie(Z)     : (have not a parent) can not control in ur system but its consumes from cpu to eneded restart the process (another methods)
4-interruptible(sleep)S  : wait action from another process to wake up  or signal
5-Unterruptible(sleep)D  : wait action from another process to wake up 


commands with process 
1-manages process(ps)
2-process monitoring(top,sar,watch)
3-killing process(kill,pkill)
4-setting priority(nice,renice)

man ps :all commands used with ps : u can add - with ps and also u can run without - mince
ps : print all process id u used 
print only specifc columns : ps -eo pid,tid,user....ppid...
pstree  : print the tree of process as network(hashtable)
ps -aux :like report get all current processes print table without lines     att(a) for all att(u) users att(x) for sort : print all process with users with sorting
ps -ef  :ike description get all process with parent like ps -aux but the columns added like ppid
ps lax  :all with priority


----print current satate
top :command like task manager details as report each processes with ids

----kill process
k okay then write id then okay then send segterm like 15 
kill -l : will print 64 signal like restart or kill ...
famous sigkill
9 kill(sigkill) (remove from system)
15 terminate process (sigterm) (closed but lsa in system)
3 restart (sigquit)
----------------------------------------------------create a sleep process

sleep 1000  :by deafult process to counter 10000 seconds will consume terminal so need to run it in background :so stoped it and wait in background as stopped process woth id and i will resumed it again 
sleep 10000 & : will run in background  not conume terminal   

----print process running in background
jobs :have running and stoped also
---resume the stoped process
bg %1 :run again job will show all running
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------kill & pkill & killall
kill(process id) & pkill(all process only login left) & killall(log out user itself)
-----------kill process using id :only kill this process (just kill one process)
ps : take id
kill pid or kill -15 pid : 15 here is segterm terminated

-----------pkill process using user name (kill all process that user made only will leave the login process as session)
pkill -u hassan        :kill all processes for the hassan only will leave login
killall -u  hassan    :kill all processes (sign out this user) (go out of my system )
