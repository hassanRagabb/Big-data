program is one or more services each service is one or more process
linux start steps:
1-bios then grup u2om kernal then systemd (u2om or start services as units )
the term "unit" refers to the configuration files that describe system services, resources
Types of Units :many types extentions almost is (.service)
1-Service Units (.service) (related to system)
2-Target Units (.target) (related to start up)
3-Device mount (.mount) (related to filesystem and mount)
4-Socket Units (.socket) for network
5-Device Units (.device) 
many ..11

Service(units have) Dependencies(like child) : parent(service_name) to be active must thier child also work(active)  : 
	systemctl list-dependencies service_name -reverse

status of service: may have more ( processes id) most end with char (d) daemon mean running in background
1-active(start its work running now) by : systemctl start sshd
2-inactive(not work now)  by : systemctl stop sshd
3-enable (run with boot start server or restart) when make it enabled will create symlink in path 
4-disable  (make enabled to disabled coz u dont it run with the boot) systemctl disable sshd (but now active 3adi but when start again will not work need to nake it enabled
5-static (for server)  user or admin cant control 3leha only kernal can 


know status using systemctl

systemctl status sshd : give u description path and job and status like enabled and active note end with char (d) daemon mean running in background










controll services command:
systemctl :is used to control and manage services that use systemd as their init system

sudo systemctl list-units -all --type=service :List All Services active plus inactive
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service :List All Services active only
systemctl | gerp fail : list faild services

sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled :List Enabled Services:
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled 

sudo systemctl status
sudo systemctl daemon-reload : (useful after making changes):
sudo systemctl start service_name
sudo systemctl stop service_name
sudo systemctl restart service_name
sudo systemctl enable service_name
sudo systemctl disable service_name
sudo systemctl status service_nam

Working with Service Dependencies
List Dependencies: sudo systemctl list-dependencies service_name
